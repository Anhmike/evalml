    "# Objective Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The **objective function** is what EvalML tries to maximize (or minimize) as it completes the pipeline search. As it gets feedback from building pipelines, it tunes the hyperparameters to build an optimized models. Therefore, it is critical to have an objective function that matches the how the model's predictions will be used in a business setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most AutoML libraries optimize a generic machine learning objective functions. Frequently, the scores produced by the generic machine learning objective diverage from how the model will be accessed once deployed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In EvalML, we can train and optimize the model for a specific problem by optimizing a domain-specific objectives functions or by defining our own custom objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## List of Available Objective Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, EvalML has two domain specific objective functions with more being developed. For more information on these objective functions click on the links below\n",

    "## Custom Objective Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, the objective function is very specific to the use-case or business problem. To get the right objective to optimize requires thinking through the decisions or actions that will be taken using the model and assigning the a cost/benifiet to doing that correctly or incorrectly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have determined the objective for your business, you can provide that to EvalML to optimize by defining a custom objective function."
